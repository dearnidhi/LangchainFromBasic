    "\n",
    "Understand that LangChain models interact with different types of messages like HumanMessage, AIMessage, etc. These are the building blocks for chat interactions in LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. BaseChatModel:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your custom chat model will inherit from BaseChatModel, which provides a standard interface for chat models. You'll need to implement at least the _generate method to define how your model generates responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implementing _generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "_generate is the key method that generates a response from the input messages. You can use it to implement your custom logic for how the model responds based on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Streaming with _stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model supports streaming responses, you can implement the _stream method. This method allows the model to return partial results as they're generated, which is useful for large or slow responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Async Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to support asynchronous execution, you can implement _agenerate and _astream, which handle async generation and streaming respectively."

These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.

This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see.
