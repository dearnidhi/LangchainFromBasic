      "The above, but trimming old messages to reduce the amount of distracting information the model has to deal with.\n",

You can access this version of the guide in the v0.2 docs.As of the v0.3 release of LangChain, we recommend that LangChain users take advantage of LangGraph persistence to incorporate memory into new LangChain applications.If your code is already relying on RunnableWithMessageHistory or BaseChatMessageHistory, you do not need to make any changes. We do not plan on deprecating this functionality in the near future as it works for simple chat applications and any code that uses RunnableWithMessageHistory will continue to work as expected.Please see How to migrate to LangGraph Memory for more details.\n",

      "Message passing‚Äã\n",
      "The simplest form of memory is simply passing chat history messages into a chain. Here's an example:\n",
      "from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessagefrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholderprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        SystemMessage(            content=\"You are a helpful assistant.

      "I said, \"I love programming\" in French: \"J'adore la programmation.\"\n",
      "We can see that by passing the previous conversation into a chain, it can use it as context to answer questions. This is the basic concept underpinning chatbot memory - the rest of the guide will demonstrate convenient techniques for passing or reformatting messages.\n",
      "Automatic history management‚Äã\n",
      "The previous examples pass messages to the chain (and model) explicitly. This is a completely acceptable approach, but it does require external management of new messages.

      "A key feature of chatbots is their ability to use content of previous conversation turns as context. This state management can take several forms, including:\n",
      "We'll go into more detail on a few techniques below!\n",
      "This how-to guide previously built a chatbot using RunnableWithMessageHistory. You can access this version of the guide in the v0.2 docs.\n",
      "As of the v0.3 release of LangChain, we recommend that LangChain users take advantage of LangGraph persistence to incorporate memory into new LangChain applications.\n",
      "If your code is already relying on RunnableWithMessageHistory or BaseChatMessageHistory, you do not need to make any changes. We do not plan on deprecating this functionality in the near future as it works for simple chat applications and any code that uses RunnableWithMessageHistory will continue to work as expected.\n",
      "Please see How to migrate to LangGraph Memory for more details.\n",
      "You'll need to install a few packages, and have your OpenAI API key set as an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY:\n",
      "Let's also set up a chat model that we'll use for the below examples.\n",
      "The simplest form of memory is simply passing chat history messages into a chain. Here's an example:\n",
      "We can see that by passing the previous conversation into a chain, it can use it as context to answer questions. This is the basic concept underpinning chatbot memory - the rest of the guide will demonstrate convenient techniques for passing or reformatting messages.\n",
      "The previous examples pass messages to the chain (and model) explicitly. This is a completely acceptable approach, but it does require external management of new messages. LangChain also provides a way to build applications that have memory using LangGraph's persistence. You can enable persistence in LangGraph applications by providing a checkpointer when compiling the graph.\n",
      "We'll pass the latest input to the conversation here and let the LangGraph keep track of the conversation history using the checkpointer:\n",
      "Modifying stored chat messages can help your chatbot handle a variety of situations. Here are some examples:\n",
      "LLMs and chat models have limited context windows, and even if you're not directly hitting limits, you may want to limit the amount of distraction the model has to deal with. One solution is trim the history messages before passing them to the model. Let's use an example history with the app we declared above:\n",
      "We can see the app remembers the preloaded name.\n",
      "But let's say we have a very small context window, and we want to trim the number of messages passed to the model to only the 2 most recent ones. We can use the built in trim_messages util to trim messages based on their token count before they reach our prompt. In this case we'll count each message as 1 \"token\" and keep only the last two messages:\n",
      "Let's call this new app and check the response\n",
      "We can see that trim_messages was called and only the two most recent messages will be passed to the model. In this case, this means that the model forgot the name we gave it.\n",
      "Check out our how to guide on trimming messages for more.\n",
      "We can use this same pattern in other ways too. For example, we could use an additional LLM call to generate a summary of the conversation before calling our app. Let's recreate our chat history:\n",
      "And now, let's update the model-calling function to distill previous interactions into a summary:\n",
      "Let's see if it remembers the name we gave it:\n",
      "Note that invoking the app again will keep accumulating the history until it reaches the specified number of messages (four in our case). At that point we will generate another summary generated from the initial summary plus new messages and so on.\n"
